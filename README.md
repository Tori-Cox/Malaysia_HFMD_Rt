# Malaysia_HFMD_Rt

This repository accompanies the paper: "Spatio-temporal dynamics of hand, foot and mouth disease in Malaysia, 2009 â€“ 2019." It contains estimates of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) Rt at the state and daily level for Malaysia between 2009 to 2019, which were estimated using national surveillance data. Aggregated numbers of HFMD cases by week and state (or federal territory) for the period 2010-2018 are publicly available on the government website data.org.my at https://archive.data.gov.my/data/ms_MY/dataset/bilangan-kes-penyakit-hfmd-mingguan-mengikut-negeri. 

This repository also contains the climate, demographic, and school closure data in seven-day rolling daily windows matched to the Rt estimates for the study period. The variables are lagged from 0 to 14 days. Example code to run the statistical analyses in the paper is provided in the R folder of this repository.
