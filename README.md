# Malaysia_HFMD_Rt

This repository accompanies the paper: "Spatio-temporal dynamics of hand, foot and mouth disease in Malaysia, 2009 â€“ 2019." 

It contains __*estimates of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) Rt*__ at the state and daily level for Malaysia between 2009 to 2019, which were estimated using national surveillance data. This repository also contains the __*climate, demographic, and school closure data*__ in seven-day rolling daily windows matched to the Rt estimates for the study period. The variables are lagged from 0 to 14 days. Example code to run the statistical analyses in the paper is provided in the R folder of this repository. 

Aggregated numbers of HFMD cases by week and state (or federal territory) for the period 2010-2018 are publicly available on the government website data.org.my at https://archive.data.gov.my/data/ms_MY/dataset/bilangan-kes-penyakit-hfmd-mingguan-mengikut-negeri.
